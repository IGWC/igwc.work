<p>On April 25, 2024, the Liberated Zone in Indiana University's (IU) Dunn Meadow began, demanding that IU divest from Israel, end its partnership with the <a href="https://blogs.iu.edu/iuimpact/2023/04/25/iu-expands-partnership-with-nswc-crane-to-advance-national-security-innovation/">Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center</a>, establish a Muslim and Middle Eastern Cultural Center, and that IU President Pamela Whitten, Provost Rahul Shrivastav, and Vice Provost Carrie Docherty resign.</p>

<p>On the first day of the encampment, <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/04/indiana-university-33-pro-palestinian-protesters-arrested-at-dunn-meadow-protest-encampment">Indiana State Police (ISP) conducted a raid</a> and removed all "temporary structures" on the orders of IU President Pamela Whitten, arresting 33 protestors in the process. During the raid, <a href="https://x.com/IUonStrike/status/1783620195581350102">Indiana State Police stationed a sniper on the roof of the Indiana Memorial Union Building (IMU)</a>â€”a fact confirmed by ISP Superintendent Doug Carter, who stated that the raid had "<a href="https://fox59.com/indiana-news/iu-offers-concessions-in-wake-of-arrests-at-dunn-meadow-protests/">overwatch positions with sniper capabilities</a>." Indiana State Police referred to this position on the IMU roof as "Overwatch" in their radio transmissions.</p>

<p>Protestors re-established the encampment the morning of April 26. Indiana State Police stationed three officers on Overwatch who relayed the movements and demeanor of the encampment using the radio channel ISP OPS 3.</p>

<p>On April 27 at 11:51am, ISP OPS 3 reactivated.</p>
